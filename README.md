A Pokedex App build with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## About

I developed this project with the goal of deepening my understanding of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The app showcases all 898 Pokemon and their associated data, including images, which are fetched using the Pokeapi.

By building this project, I was able to practice implementing dynamic data and exploring the capabilities of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I also gained experience in using external APIs to fetch data and integrate it into a web application.
